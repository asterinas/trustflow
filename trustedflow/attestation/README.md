# Trustedflow Attestation Library

Trustedflow Attestation Library provides the ability to generate and verify remote attestation reports for different TEE hardware devices. Currently, it supports Intel SGX2, Intel TDX and Hygon CSV.

## Build

### Bazel
Bazel supports building the generation and verification modules for the Linux platform.

**Compiling the verification module**
```
bazel build //trustedflow/attestation/verification/wrapper:libverification.so -c opt
```
The generated path for libverification.so is `bazel-bin/trustedflow/attestation/verification/wrapper/libverification.so`

**Compiling the generation module**

Because the generation needs to be bound to a specific TEE platform, you need to specify the platform type when compiling:

Intel SGX2 and running with Occlum: `--define tee_type=sgx2`

Intel TDX: `--define tee_type=tdx`

Hygon CSV: `--define tee_type=csv`

For example, Intel TDXï¼š
```
bazel build --define tee_type=tdx //trustedflow/attestation/generation/wrapper:libgeneration.so -c opt
```
The generated path for libgeneration.so is `bazel-bin/trustedflow/attestation/generation/wrapper/libgeneration.so`

### CMake
CMake currently only supports compiling the verification module using WebAssembly to enable remote attestation execution on the Web.
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cd build && make
```
The generated JS file path is `trustedflow/attestation/verification/trustedflow_verifier.js`
For sample code using this JS file, refer to [here](sample/verification/wasm/sample_react_app/README.md)

## Multi-Language Support

Currently supports C/C++, Python, Rust
